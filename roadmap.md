# Roadmap

For now we consider the file-pattern-scanner feature complete, but please contribute with any ideas you have through issues.

We still have some overall ideas for further development:

* We consider to wrap it in a Jenkins plugin also, as this makes is visible to a large userbase and ease the usage compared to a stand-alone script.
* We consider to later include in our [code-utils project](https://github.com/Praqma/code-utils), if the code-utils [one day becomes a gradle plugin](https://github.com/Praqma/code-utils#the-praqmatic-code-util-gradle-plugin)
